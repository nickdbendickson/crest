/**
 * The web deploy: TanStack Start (SSR shell, one route, `/`) built with Nitro's Vercel preset. The desk itself is
 * client-only (Leaflet, localStorage, IndexedDB); the server renders the `<html>` shell and serves the client bundle.
 * It has no database, no auth and no server middleware: the app-builder scaffolding that once lived here (PGLite
 * bootstrap, the OAuth popup, the app-env endpoint, the PWA install page) was never used by the desk and was removed
 * on 2026-11-08. The desktop app and Crest.html are built by vite.desktop.config.ts instead.
 *
 * `0.0.0.0:8080` is the dev-server contract (startup.sh and the smoke tests expect it).
