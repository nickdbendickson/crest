/**
 * The warning catalogue (2026-11-08). Until now only the two NID height checks had codes (W-H1, W-H2 in nid-dams.ts);
 * every other flag the engine, the inundation build and the picker raise was free text, rendered with the text as its
 * React key (two equal texts collided) and impossible to point at in a report or a bug. Each warning now carries a
 * stable code and a severity beside its text. The text is unchanged everywhere: `warningText()` hands consumers and
 * tests that still expect strings exactly what they had, and no threshold or wording moved.
 *
 *   code      where it is raised                         severity
 *   W-D1      engine.ts datum rules (DEM tie, VERTCON,   warn (stop when the crest could not be tied: the screen is
 *             local band, streambed replaced)            held at Review)
 *   W-V1      engine.ts bounded() (an input outside the  warn (clamped to the desk range) / info (a missing input
 *             desk range) and inundation.ts volumeCheck  replaced by the placeholder, the volume band)
 *   W-R1      reach.ts / inundation.ts: the routed       warn
 *             flood still reaches the terrain's edge
 *             with water to carry (reach incomplete)
 *   W-E1      inundation.ts probeExtent failed, so the   info
 *             layer has no extent check
 *   W-P1      engine.ts: a 911 pad kept at 0 because the stop (the screen is held at Review)
 *             terrain for it could not be read
 *   W-S1      outline.ts outlineState: the saved layer   info
 *             is stale (inputs changed, old trace)
 *   W-H1/H2   nid-dams.ts NID height checks               warn
 *
 * The README lists the codes under "Warning codes".
