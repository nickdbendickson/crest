/**
 * The inundation-layer gate (Nick, 2026-11-02). Step 5 scored the routed terrain flood (routed-flood.ts) against the
 * ND Breach Runner on the four-dam baseline and found it beats the bathtub outline only on the one LARGE dam
 * (DWR-2801, a 6,144-ac flood) and loses on the small ones (38–256 ac), where a 1-D route down a thalweg is too fine
 * a target and, on the smallest, the trace misses the flood entirely.
 *
 * None of the model-independent "confinement" signals tried (the can't-carry-peak fraction, the envelope-to-released
 * volume ratio, the section bank relief) separates the win from the losses. The one thing that does is flood SIZE,
 * and that is knowable before any model run: the released breach volume. So the gate is a size gate — route the big
 * floods, fall back to the existing bathtub outline for the small ones — not an attempt to detect confinement.
 *
 * The threshold is calibrated on thin data (one large dam on the win side), so GATE_VOLUME_ACFT is a tunable constant,
 * not a law; a few more large-dam runs should firm it up. The gate is a-priori (released volume only), so it needs no
 * DEM and no model to decide; buildInundation then builds only the layer the gate picks.
 *
 * Since 2026-11-03 (Nick) the routed layer is the quasi-dynamic 2-D volume spread (spread.ts) rather than the stage
 * fill: on the corrected DEM (crest PR #35) with closed-basin storage (PR #36) it beats the outline on all four
 * baseline dams and lays down 2–6× the release, where the stage fill laid down 31–779×. The stage fill stays available
 * with { method: "stage" }.
