/**
 * The routed terrain flood (step 5 of the terrain-inundation plan, Nick, 2026-11-01): the four building blocks wired
 * together into one inundation layer.
 *
 *   outline.ts traces the drainage channel from the breach
 *     → sections.ts cuts DEM cross-sections along it
 *       → routing.ts routes the breach outflow hydrograph to a water surface at each section
 *         → fill.ts spreads that surface over the terrain
 *
 * Unlike the terrain outline (which bathtubs the desk's schematic depths on a narrow corridor with no routing), this
 * routes the actual breach hydrograph down the real valley and fills to the routed water surface, so the depth and
 * the extent come from hydraulics on the ground rather than from the schematic valley.
 *
 * Pure module (no DOM, no fetch); it is given the DEM, as buildOutline is. The output depth grid is in feet on the
 * DEM's own bbox, which is exactly the validation harness's `lonlat` candidate, so it can be scored against a Runner
 * run without polygonising first; the app (and the exports) polygonise it the way the outline does.
